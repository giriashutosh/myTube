Debouncing 
Performance

typing slow = 14 letters * 1000 = 14000
typing fast = 3 API calls * 1000 = 3000 
API Call is heavy because of handshake and all process.

Debouncing with 200ms
 - if difference between 2 key strokes is < 200ms - Decline API call
 - if it is > 200ms - make the API call

key-i
 -render the component
 -useEffect()
 -start the timer => make api call after 200ms
key -ip
 -destroying the component (useEffect return method)
 -re-render the component
 -useEffect()
 -start the timer => make api call after 200ms

 Need to done
 - youtube search suggestion api gave us the data in XML format.
 -Implement the debouncing in search query in the header.
